# REVOLUTIONIZING SATELLITE LIFETIME PREDICTION: A SURVIVAL ANALYSIS APPROACH FOR AEROSPACE AGENCIES

The data come from UCS Satellite Database and Satellite Catalog (SATCAT)

**Goal:**  
<<<<<<< HEAD
Intrducing a new approach that applies Survival Analysis in order to provide a more precise prediction of satellite lifetimes to space agencies.
=======
We aim to provide a more precise prediction of satellite lifetimes to space agencies, in order to mitigate the risk of premature satellite
loss by enabling preventive maintenance.
Furthermore we demonstrate why the American market is the most suitable for starting our business.
