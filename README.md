# SURVIVAL ANALYSIS TO SUPPORT SATELLITES LIFETIME PREDICTION

The data come from UCS Satellite Database, which contains 6718 satellites currently orbiting Earth, and 28 types of data for each satellite.  

**Goal:**  
We aim to identify the factors that determine the operational lifetime of a satellite in order to contextualize the economic and environmental impacts of space missions.  
We plan to compare the expected lifetime of satellites as indicated by their owners withthe lifetime predicted by our analysis.

**Dataset:**
