# REVOLUTIONIZING SATELLITE LIFETIME PREDICTION: A SURVIVAL ANALYSIS APPROACH FOR AEROSPACE AGENCIES

The data come from UCS Satellite Database and Satellite Catalog (SATCAT)

**Goal:**  
Intrducing a new approach that applies Survival Analysis in order to provide a more precise prediction of satellite lifetimes to space agencies.
We aim to provide a more precise prediction of satellite lifetimes to space agencies, in order to mitigate the risk of premature satellite
loss by enabling preventive maintenance.
