# SURVIVAL ANALYSIS TO SUPPORT SATELLITES LIFETIME PREDICTION

The data come from UCS Satellite Database, which contains 6718 satellites currently orbiting Earth, and 28 types of data for each satellite.  

**Goal:**  
We aim to provide a more precise prediction of satellite lifetimes to space agencies, in order to mitigate the risk of premature satellite
loss by enabling preventive maintenance.
Furthermore we demonstrate why the American market is the most suitable for starting our business.
